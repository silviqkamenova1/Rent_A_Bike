                    <p className="long_text1">ENVE will provide Team TotalEnergies with its Melee road bike, wheels and components for the next two seasons.

                        TotalEnergie previously used Specialized bikes, but ENVE will expand its presence in professional road cycling with the new partnership.

                        ENVE says it will continue to provide the WorldTour team UAE Team Emirates with its SES wheels and SES Aero One-Piece handlebar. Ivan Basso and Alberto Contador's project, Team Polti Kometa, will also remain on ENVE wheels. Before releasing the Custom Road in 2021, ENVE had focused on producing wheels and other components, such as handlebars, stems and forks.

                        The Melee, released in July 2022, was the brand's second bike. Unlike the Custom Road, which can be configured to your specific needs, ENVE chose to produce the Melee in a more conventional range of seven sizes.

                        The partnership between Team TotalEnergies and ENVE will be the first time the Melee has been raced in the professional peloton.

                        Team TotalEnergies manager Jean-Ren√© Bernaudeau says the team were already familiar with ENVE's wheels, but discussions with ENVE's engineers began in October.
